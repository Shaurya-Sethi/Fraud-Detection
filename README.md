# Fraud-Detection
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent bank notes by analyzing features extracted from wavelet transforms. It compares the performance of a Neural Network and a Random Forest model, providing insights into their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classifying genuine vs. fraudulent notes.
